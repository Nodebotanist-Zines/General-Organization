# Mission Statement

## Mission Statement

This project is being created in order to create more accessible, open, free content to people interested in getting started in hobbyist robotics and NodeBots. We want to bring the community together, swap information, inspire both each other and future NodeBots/robotics inventors. We want to build to diverse community that we want to see in the hardware community at large. And most of all, we want to share and hopefully spread our love of hobbyist hardware in a free and accessible way.
